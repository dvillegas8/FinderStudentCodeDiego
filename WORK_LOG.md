Additionally, I finished the query function by storing the key-value pairs into an object and into an array. Afterwards, I would go through the array and check to see if the keys match. I need to look for ways to have faster lookups for my query function because right now it is linear runtime. |

Basically, I hashed all of my keys and put the hash value as the index of the array and the value as the actual value of the key. I finished implementing this in case, I need to do some research on how I can potentially make this faster. |
| October 30 |  7:30 - 8:30  | I messed around with the P value and figured out at the smallest P value I can have is 811. Additionally, I messed with the R value and figured out that the smallest R value I can have is 122 which is the ASCII value of y + 1. I wasn't sure on how to make my size of the array smaller, so I started to do some research on google and figured out a method that interested me. It suggested that if I have a collision I move on to the nearest empty index. However, I thought that this wouldn't work because when we recieve a key and are looking for the value, how do we know if the key is a collision key and where the actual value is stored. Furthermore, I figured out that my finderTester only works for the elements array so I need to make it universal. The reason it only works for the elements array is because R group corresponds with the smallest character in that csv file specifically. Also, I probably need to make the P value bigger. |

Added the constructor, the instance variables, and Finished the put and get value part of the hashmap. Working on resizing, I am not sure on how to implement this part though. |

Additionally, I decided to make a new function called rehash in order so that when we call resize, it doesn't make unnecessary check of the load factor when we call put. Right now I am getting an index out of bounds error that I need to fix. I believe this is because there is something wrong when we are trying to wrap around the array to the beginning. |

Additionally, I found that my code only words for one of the tests and is correct while the others wont show me the results at all. I ran the debugger and I found out my code is constantly having to check the boxes to the right. For example, if my index is 100, it is having to check like 40 boxes before it finds an empty one. I am not sure as to why this is happening but I know there is something wrong because in class we discussed that the average number of times we check the boxes to the right is like 3 or 2. |

Additionally, I had an error for the elements test that it didn't return "INVALID KEY" when we find a null value and so I fixed that by adding a if statement in my getValue function. |

Additionally, wrote some more comments in my code to make it less confusing for someone that is reading it. |
