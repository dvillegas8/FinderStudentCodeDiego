Additionally, I finished the query function by storing the key-value pairs into an object and into an array. Afterwards, I would go through the array and check to see if the keys match. I need to look for ways to have faster lookups for my query function because right now it is linear runtime. |

Basically, I hashed all of my keys and put the hash value as the index of the array and the value as the actual value of the key. I finished implementing this in case, I need to do some research on how I can potentially make this faster. |
| October 30 |  7:30 - 8:30  | I messed around with the P value and figured out at the smallest P value I can have is 811. Additionally, I messed with the R value and figured out that the smallest R value I can have is 122 which is the ASCII value of y + 1. I wasn't sure on how to make my size of the array smaller, so I started to do some research on google and figured out a method that interested me. It suggested that if I have a collision I move on to the nearest empty index. However, I thought that this wouldn't work because when we recieve a key and are looking for the value, how do we know if the key is a collision key and where the actual value is stored. Furthermore, I figured out that my finderTester only works for the elements array so I need to make it universal. The reason it only works for the elements array is because R group corresponds with the smallest character in that csv file specifically. Also, I probably need to make the P value bigger. |
